# Terraform Governance Pattern

## When to use

- Creating or reviewing any Terraform infrastructure
- Adding new environments or modules
- SPEC-009 compliance review

## Core idea

Every deployable environment must have: mandatory tags on all resources, at
least one AWS Budget with alerting, and an explicit versioning decision.
No environment should exist without cost governance.

---

## Tagging enforcement

All resources must carry these five tags via `local.common_tags`:

```hcl
locals {
  common_tags = merge(
    var.tags,
    {
      Project     = var.project_name
      Environment = var.environment
      Owner       = var.owner
      ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
      CostCenter  = var.cost_center
    }
  )
}
```

Required variables:

```hcl
variable "cost_center" {
  description = "Cost center for budget allocation and cost reporting."
  type        = string
  default     = "engineering"
}
```

Never create a resource without `tags = local.common_tags`.

---

## Budget governance

Every project must declare at least one `aws_budgets_budget`:

```hcl
resource "aws_budgets_budget" "monthly" {
  name              = "${local.name_prefix}-monthly-budget"
  budget_type       = "COST"
  limit_amount      = tostring(var.budget_limit_usd)
  limit_unit        = "USD"
  time_unit         = "MONTHLY"
  time_period_start = "2024-01-01_00:00"

  cost_filter {
    name   = "TagKeyValue"
    values = ["user:Project$${var.project_name}"]
  }

  notification {
    comparison_operator        = "GREATER_THAN"
    threshold                  = 80
    threshold_type             = "PERCENTAGE"
    notification_type          = "ACTUAL"
    subscriber_email_addresses = var.budget_alert_email != "" ? [var.budget_alert_email] : []
  }

  notification {
    comparison_operator        = "GREATER_THAN"
    threshold                  = 100
    threshold_type             = "PERCENTAGE"
    notification_type          = "FORECASTED"
    subscriber_email_addresses = var.budget_alert_email != "" ? [var.budget_alert_email] : []
  }
}
```

Budget alert via SNS (optional, activated when email is provided):

```hcl
resource "aws_sns_topic" "budget_alerts" {
  count = var.budget_alert_email != "" ? 1 : 0
  name  = "${local.name_prefix}-budget-alerts"
  tags  = local.common_tags
}

resource "aws_sns_topic_subscription" "budget_email" {
  count     = var.budget_alert_email != "" ? 1 : 0
  topic_arn = aws_sns_topic.budget_alerts[0].arn
  protocol  = "email"
  endpoint  = var.budget_alert_email
}
```

Required variables:

```hcl
variable "budget_limit_usd" {
  description = "Monthly budget limit in USD."
  type        = number
  default     = 25
}

variable "budget_alert_email" {
  description = "Email for budget alerts. Empty to skip SNS creation."
  type        = string
  default     = ""
}
```

---

## Versioning policy (SPEC-009 §8.3)

S3 versioning must be **disabled by default**. Enable only when explicitly
requested and documented.

```hcl
variable "enable_artifact_bucket_versioning" {
  description = "Enable S3 versioning. Off by default — activating it incurs storage costs and complicates destroy."
  type        = bool
  default     = false
}
```

Rationale: versioning causes hidden costs, storage accumulation, and
`terraform destroy` complexity in demo/lab environments.

**Educational exception:** the Session 3 data-lake lab in this course
deliberately sets `enable_artifact_bucket_versioning = true` to teach object
versioning and recovery — see `ai/skills/aws/s3_data_lake.md`. This is a
lab-scoped, explicitly justified override achieved through the existing flag
above, not a change to this policy's default. The default stays `false` for
every other environment, and the `## Avoid` guidance below is unchanged: the
lab's explicit justification *is* the exception process this policy expects,
not a precedent for enabling versioning elsewhere without one.

---

## Drift management process (SPEC-009 §8.2)

If a resource is modified manually through the AWS Console:

1. Detect drift: `terraform plan` will show the diff
2. Remove from state: `terraform state rm <resource_address>`
3. Re-import: `terraform import <resource_address> <aws_id>`
4. Update Terraform code to match the real state
5. Run `terraform plan` again to confirm zero diff

Never delete `terraform.tfstate` to resolve drift — this orphans infrastructure.

---

## State protection (SPEC-009 §8.1)

- Remote backend is mandatory (S3 with native locking — see SPEC-008)
- Never run `rm terraform.tfstate`
- State modifications require agent approval (see `AGENTS.md` approval boundaries)

---

## Per-Service Cost Awareness

Some services in this stack have variable, per-unit pricing that makes budget overruns easy to miss. Apply closer monitoring to:

| Service | Billing driver | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Bedrock | Per input/output token | Runaway LLM calls in loops or retries |
| Textract | Per page analysed | Multi-page TIF files at scale |
| Glue | Per DPU-hour (min 10 DPUs × 10 min) | Long-running or mis-configured jobs |
| S3 | Storage + GET/PUT requests | Unbounded pipeline retries writing duplicate objects |

For each of these services, create a separate `aws_budgets_budget` scoped to the service using a `SERVICE` cost filter, or rely on the project-level budget plus CloudWatch metric alarms on the relevant service dimensions.

### Cost Explorer tag filter

To query spend per project using Cost Explorer, filter by the `Project` and `CostCenter` tags already mandated by `local.common_tags`. These tags must be activated in the AWS Billing console under **Cost allocation tags** before they appear in Cost Explorer.

### Alarm threshold recommendation

- 80% of monthly limit → `ACTUAL` spend alarm (real spend exceeded threshold)
- 100% of monthly limit → `FORECASTED` spend alarm (projected to exceed before month end)

This matches the two-notification pattern already defined in the `aws_budgets_budget` block above.

For per-service cost detail, see:
- `ai/skills/aws/textract.md` — page count logging
- `ai/skills/python/bedrock_client.md` — token guard and throttle handling
- `ai/skills/terraform/terraform_observability.md` — mandatory outputs and log group naming that consume `local.common_tags`

---

## Avoid

- Resources without `tags = local.common_tags`
- Deploying without an `aws_budgets_budget`
- Enabling S3 versioning without explicit justification
- Resolving drift by deleting state files
- Using `terraform apply` without a prior `terraform plan` review
- Activating cost allocation tags in code only — they must also be activated in the AWS Billing console
