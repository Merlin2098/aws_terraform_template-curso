# Domain: Terraform

## Purpose

Guidance for declaring, testing, and maintaining AWS infrastructure as code using
Terraform. This domain covers module design, state management, CI/CD integration,
security, governance, and environment promotion. It is the authoritative source for
how infrastructure is written and managed — not what AWS services do (see `ai/domains/aws.md`).

---

## Scope

| In scope | Out of scope |
|---|---|
| Terraform module design and style | AWS service behaviour and usage patterns (see `ai/domains/aws.md`) |
| State backends and remote state | Python or shell scripts that invoke Terraform |
| IAM least privilege in Terraform | Application code deployed onto the infrastructure |
| Terraform testing (unit, integration, mocks) | Data pipeline logic (see `ai/domains/data-product.md`) |
| CI/CD for Terraform (plan, apply, drift) | |
| Tagging, budget, and cost governance | |
| Environment promotion (dev → staging → prod) | |
| Resource import (manual and discovery) | |
| Security and observability outputs | |

## Policies

No domain-specific policies beyond the global set. See [`ai/policies/global.md`](../policies/global.md).

Key constraints from `AGENTS.md` that are enforced at the Terraform level:

- `terraform apply` and `terraform destroy` require explicit user approval — never run autonomously.
- IAM changes require explicit review before applying.
- S3 versioning must not be enabled by default — only when explicitly requested and justified.
- Every resource must carry `local.common_tags` including `CostCenter`.
- Every module must expose `log_group_name`, `log_group_arn`, and `resource_arn` as outputs.
- `terraform.tfstate` must never be deleted or overwritten.

Preferred execution:

- Use `make <target>` when available.
- On Windows, use `scripts/windows/run_make.ps1` or the documented wrapper.
- Run Terraform commands directly from `infra/` — never introduce hidden automation.
