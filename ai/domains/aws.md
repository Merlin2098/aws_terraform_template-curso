# Domain: AWS

## Purpose

Guidance for using AWS managed services correctly and securely. This domain covers
service-specific patterns, IAM configuration, observability, and smoke testing.
It does not cover how to declare those services in Terraform — that belongs in
`ai/domains/terraform.md`.

## Scope

| In scope | Out of scope |
|---|---|
| Service-specific usage patterns (Lambda, S3, SQS, etc.) | Terraform resource declarations (see `ai/domains/terraform.md`) |
| IAM role and policy design | Python job code running on AWS (see `ai/domains/python.md`) |
| CloudWatch logging and observability | Data pipeline logic (see `ai/domains/data-product.md`) |
| Smoke testing and resource validation | |
| API Gateway, CloudFront, Cognito patterns | React frontend code (see `ai/domains/frontend.md`) |
| Bedrock model access and invocation | |
| Textract async workflows | |

## Policies

No domain-specific policies beyond the global set. See [`ai/policies/global.md`](../policies/global.md).

Key global policies with strong AWS implications:

- **Security By Default** — all S3 buckets block public access; IAM roles use least privilege; no wildcard resource ARNs in production.
- **Configuration Over Hardcoding** — ARNs, bucket names, and queue URLs come from Terraform outputs or environment variables, never hardcoded.

Additional constraints from `AGENTS.md` (SPEC-009):

- Every service that produces logs must have an explicit `aws_cloudwatch_log_group` with `retention_in_days` set.
- Every environment must include `aws_budgets_budget`.
- `local.common_tags` (including `CostCenter`) must be applied to every resource.
