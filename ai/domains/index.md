# Domain Index

Navigation map for all skill domains in this framework.
This file complements `ai/skills.yaml` (authoritative slug index) with semantic grouping by domain.

---

## How to use this index

1. Identify the domain of your task from the table below.
2. Find the relevant skill file(s).
3. Check `ai/skills.yaml` for the canonical slug to use in references.
4. For cross-domain tasks, consult skills from each relevant domain.

## Global Policies

All domains are subject to the policies in [`ai/policies/global.md`](../policies/global.md).

---

## Adding a New Domain

1. Create `ai/skills/<domain>/` with skill files following the recipe format.
2. Register each skill in `ai/skills.yaml` with a unique slug.
3. Add a row block for the domain in this file.
4. If the domain is large, create `ai/domains/<domain>.md` as a dedicated descriptor.
5. Register each skill in `ai/skills.yaml` and add a row in this index for the new domain.
6. Add the new path to `ai/context.yaml` under `structure.guidance`.
